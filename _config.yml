  Hi, my name's Brett and I'm a senior network system administrator. 
  I am interested in the design and benchmarking of complex distributed software systems or data-intensive applications. In particular, I am interested in software architectures, virtualization, performance optimizations, scalability, effective storage and processing of structured and unstructured data in large systems.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
