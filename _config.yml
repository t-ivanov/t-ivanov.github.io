          At the heart of DataBench is the goal to design a benchmarking process helping European organizations developing Big Data Technologies to reach for excellence and constantly improve their performance, by measuring their technology development activity against parameters of high business relevance.
          
          DataBench will investigate existing Big Data benchmarking tools and projects, identify the main gaps and provide a robust set of metrics to compare technical results coming from those tools.

          Transport researchers and policy makers today face several challenges as they work to build efficient, safe, and sustainable transportation systems. From rising congestion to growing demand for public transit, the travel behaviour and transportation preferences of city dwellers are changing fast. 
          
          Leveraging Big Data to Manage Transport Operations (LeMO) project will address these issues by investigating the implications
          of the utilisation of such big data to enhance the economic sustainability and competitiveness of European transport sector. 
          
          The project will study and analyse big data in the European transport domain in particular with respect to five transport dimensions -  mode, sector, technology, policy and evaluation.

          The hands-on lab will investigate the features and usability of emerging AI/ML tools focused on Fairness, Bias, Transparency, Explainability and similar Ethical aspects in AI. 
          
          The goal is to practically apply the tools in real use cases with data sets either provided by the tool vendors or developed by the teams. Based on their experience the participants will perform an assessment of the tools they use as well as feature comparison. 
          
          All outcomes of the investigations will be reported in the final presentation. In particular the tools that we look at are Google What-If, IBM AI Fairness 360, IBM AI Explainability 360, Captum PyTorch and MS InterpretML.

          The goal of the course is to provide the students with practical hands-on experience with Big Data, Deep Learning, AI systems and new types of storage platforms and frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, Kubeflow, TensorFlow and Kuberenetes. 
          
          Students will have to choose one of the given topics, in teams of two students, and need to be actively participating at the weekly meetings. 
          
          The course is divided into two phases. In the first phase the student teams will setup, install and get to know the cloud environment (Google Cloud Platform) and the platform they selected to work with. 
          
          In the second phase, the teams will propose a realistic Big Data scenario using real data sets and implement it on the platform they setup in the first phase. 
          
          The final implementations and results will be presented (graded) at the end of the course in front of all students.
